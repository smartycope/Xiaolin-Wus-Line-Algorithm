    Xiaolin Wu's Line Algorithm
    ==========================
    
    A simple program that draws lines between mouse clicks. The lines are drawn
    using the Xiaolin Wu's Line Algorithm, i.e. the lines are anti-aliased.
    
    Controls: 
    Left Mouse Button : Add a point to the current layer
    
    Right Mouse Button: Remove a point from the current layer. If the layer is
                        empty then it will remove the latest layer.
                        
    Space:              Create a new layer from all the points in the current 
                        layer.
